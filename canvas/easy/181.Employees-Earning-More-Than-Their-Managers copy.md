# The problem given

```Table: Employee```

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |

```id``` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  

Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager. 

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

## Example 1:

### Input: ```Employee table:```  
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |

### Output:
| Employee |
|----------|
| Joe      |

Detailed Explanation  

1. SELECT E.name AS Employee:

    * SELECT is the clause we use to select the columns we want to see in the result.

    * E.name refers to the name column in the table we nicknamed E (the employee).

    * AS Employee is a column alias (nickname). It renames the name column to Employee in the result of your query, according to the output format required by the problem.

2. FROM Employee AS E:

    * FROM indicates the table from which we will retrieve the data.

    * Employee AS E is the crucial part of the auto-join. Here, we are referencing the Employee table and giving it the nickname E. From now on, E represents the employee table.

3. JOIN Employee AS M ON E.managerId = M.id:

    * JOIN is the clause we use to combine rows from two or more tables.

    * Employee AS M is the second reference to the same Employee table, but this time with the nickname M. M represents the manager table.

    * ON E.managerId = M.id is the join condition. It tells MySQL how the rows of the two virtual “tables” (E and M) should be connected. This condition joins an employee (E) to their manager (M) by ensuring that the employee's managerId is equal to the manager's id.

4. WHERE E.salary > M.salary:

    * WHERE is the clause used to filter results based on a condition.

    * E.salary refers to the employee's salary.

    * M.salary refers to the manager's salary.

    * The condition E.salary > M.salary filters the rows and returns only those where the employee's salary is greater than their manager's salary.
